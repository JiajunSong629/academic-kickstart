## 1.1 Types of investigation

Experiments means that an investigation where the system under study is under the control of the inversigator. By contrast in an observational study some of these features and allocation of individuals to treatment groups are outside the investigator's control.

The distinction between experiment and observational study lies in the firmness of the intrepretation that can be given to the apparent differences in response between the two group of paitients.

We translate the objective into that of comparing the responses among different treatments.

An experiment and an observation study may have identical objectives while **the distinction between them lies in the confidence to be put in the interpretation.**

## 1.2 Observational studies

*prospective study* observations are made on individuals at entry into the study, the individuals are followed forward in time. *retropective study* the response is recorded at entry and look backwards in time for possible explanatory features. *cross-sectional study* each individual is observed at just one time point. These three studies the investigator may have substantial control not only over which individuals are included but also over the measuring processes used. *secondary analysis* the investigator has control only over the inclusion or exclusion of the individuals for analysis.

The four possibilities are in decreasing order of effectiveness, and are also in decreasing order of cost.

In epidemoological applications, a retrospective study is often designed as a case-control study, whereby groups of patients with a disease or condition(cases), are compared to a hopefully similar group of disease-free patients on their exposure to one or more risk factors.
